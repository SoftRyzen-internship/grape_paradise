The component Logo takes 2 props:
  "theme" with a value of "white" or "green"
  "size" with a value of "small" or "big".
  
Depending on the value, a company's logo of a certain size and color is rendered.
For example, for Footer: <Logo theme='green' size='big' />

By default theme === "white" size="small".
